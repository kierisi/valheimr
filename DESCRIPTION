Description: Item and recipe data from the Valheim video game in a tidy format. 
    The data was scraped from Jotunn: The Valheim Library. Given that Valheim is 
    still in Early Release, please use this package with caution, as it is 
    expected to evolve significantly as the game is further developed.
